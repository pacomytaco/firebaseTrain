# firebaseTrain

week 7: Train Schedule using Firebase

I created this project using: 
    -HTML + CSS to setup andd style the page.
    - javascript, jQuery,  to moment.js to retrieve and manipulate information.
    -Firebase database to store my data. 

This application is fully functional in terms of displaying trains, however it is still a work in progress (ie. clearing form input & page styling)
